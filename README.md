**Functional programming in Java<br />**
_By: Rutger van Velzen_

## The goal is
* Understand what **FP** is and what it isn't
* Understand how it can benefit you in your daily work
* Understand what doors it can open for scalability
* Understand how it can prevent bugs
* Learn to read, write and maintain it
* Get more comfortable with the syntax.
* Recognizing the current mistakes (Like the use of `state` and `null`)

### Hands-on
I have written a small class in the `Imperative` style, at first it looks good; until
 you want something similar but yet a _tiny bit_ different.
With `higher-order functions` we can change this with ease, and make it look gorgeous
 in the process! Often this comes with additional benefits such as `lazy evaluation` and
 if you recognize a `Monoid` you can do it in parallel as well!

####If you want to dive deeper in **FP** with Java.<br>Here an interesting article :
* [Java without if](http://ashtonkemerling.com/posts/java-without-if/)
####And some great Libraries : 
* [Vavr](http://www.vavr.io/)
* [Functional java](https://www.functionaljava.org/)
* [Aparapi](http://aparapi.com/)
* [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
* [Apache Memorize](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/concurrent/Memoizer.html)
* [Palatable/Lambda](https://github.com/palatable/lambda)
####Don't forget the other `JVM` Languages
* [Clojure (Lisp)](https://clojure.org/index)
* [Eta (Haskell)](https://eta-lang.org/)
* [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
